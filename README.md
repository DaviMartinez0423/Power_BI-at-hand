# Power_BI-by a Rockie

This repository contains a Power BI made by my own, of course, due to this is not a profesional version, it won't contain whole tools that the official Power BI has and the capacities are highly limited.

# How to use it

Using this repository is really easy:

First, open a terminal and clone the respository with this command 

<div style="background-color: #000000;font-size: 14px ;color: #FFFFFF; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc">
    <pre>
        git clone https://github.com/DaviMartinez0423/Power_BI-at-hand.git
    </pre>
</div>

Then, open the folder and execute the file 'power_bi.py'

<div style="background-color: #000000;font-size: 14px ;color: #FFFFFF; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc">
    <pre>
        python power_bi.py
    </pre>
